Programming background: I am a relatively new programmer. I initially came to it not through
practical experience but through studying computational theory: on a fateful day about a 
year and half ago, I stuck my nose into a textbook on computational theory that once belonged 
to my old  college roommate and that happened into my possession. Doing problems out of this 
text lead me to learning a little Python, and now here I am! 

Most of my programming experience is concentrated in the last few months, in CS 165. My final
project for that class I am strongly considering building upon for my project in this class. 
I developed several classes for implementing context-free grammars for English sentences
and adding vocabulary to them quickly and with flexibility (i.e., I can define new 
parts of speech, or different categories of existing parts of speech, pretty easily). 
I can conceivably make auto-generating grammar quizzes on just about any aspect of English 
grammar I'd like to test (I work as an English teacher) using randomly created sentences.
This isn't a reality yet, though! At this point the vocabulary I've introduced is very barebones, 
and the one grammar I've created commits some pretty bad solecisms, but the abstraction, 
encapsulation, and exception-testing provided by the program allow me to work pretty easily 
both with the grammar and vocab side of this. So I'd like to spruce up this project and make 
a website that allows students (like my students!) to test their grammar.
