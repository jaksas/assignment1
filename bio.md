Programming background: I am a relatively new programmer. I initially came to it not through
practical experience but through studying computational theory: on a fateful day about a 
year and half ago, I stuck my nose into a textbook on computational theory that once belonged 
to my old  college roommate and that happened into my possession. Doing problems out of this 
text lead me to learning a little Python, and now here I am!
